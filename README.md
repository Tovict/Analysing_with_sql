# AnalyZing_Dataset_With_PostgreSQL

Every year, school test results play a role in deciding the fate of millions of students. In America, the SAT is a major part of the college admissions process.

In this project, I worked with a SQL database containing test performance from NYC's public schools.

I lookood at how performance varies by borough, identify how many schools fail to report information, and find the top ten performing schools across the city!
